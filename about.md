In my professional life I'm the Associate Director of the Women Writers Project and the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks at Northeastern University. On the weekends, I spend whatever time I can steal outside and I've always enjoyed looking for interesting plants and animals, and learning about the natural world. 

I set this page up as a way to learn more about GitHub Pages and as a test example for the NULab Project Seminar course that I co-teach with [Julia Flanders](https://juliaflanders.github.io/).
