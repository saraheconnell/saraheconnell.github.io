This repository was created as a test and demonstration site for the NULab Project Seminar course, which is a core class in the [Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities](https://web.northeastern.edu/nulab/teaching/dh-certificate/) at Northeastern University.

I am grateful to Barry Clark, whose [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) made it so easy to get started with my site!
