title: 2020 data update
---

I started my nature journal in April of 2020, thinking it would be an activity just for the summer—but I found that I really enjoyed paying close attention to the wildlife in my area and I’ve continued the little project for a year & a half now. Picking up this blog again about a year after I did the first set of posts (a cycle that mysteriously corresponds to when Julia Flanders and I teach a GitHub Pages unit in our DH project class), I now have a lot more data to look at. 

Since I began tracking animals a few months in, I don’t have a full year of data for 2020, but I can at least share an update on the last couple months of the year. The initial and most obvious result is that the number of sightings dropped dramatically, especially in December, where I only have 8 total. Most of the animals I saw in December were birds: turkeys, hawks, swans, and a woodpecker. I did also see one deer. Once the snow fell, I stopped seeing the rabbits that were an almost daily presence during the summer. There were a few more animals in November—23 sightings—but that’s still a far cry from the 81 I had in August and even the 78 in September. 

I’m not going to do a full analysis of 2021 until the year is over, but in the next post I’ll have a quick rundown of the highlights for this year so far. Informally, January was a bit less quiet than December, with19 sightings, and overall I seem to have seen more animals this year. Or, maybe I’m just getting better at spotting them! 

Here’s a chart with the full set of sightings I have for 2020:
