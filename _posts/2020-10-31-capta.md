title: On data, capta, and the timing of bats
---

Thinking of Johanna Drucker's concepts of [data and capta](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html), I am reminded that this project says as much or more about my own activities as it does about animal life in my area. A very obvious indication of this is the fact that I saw green crabs and hermit crabs on just two occasions: September 12 and 26, which is to say, two days that I happen to have gone to the ocean. These data points tell us nothing about the activities of marine life; they simply reflect my own movements.

A slightly more complicated example is the case of bats: I had a solitary sighting in May, but most of the days I saw bats were in August through October. There is one little cluster in August and early September and then another in the middle and end of August. I am sure that there were many bats in my area throughout the summer, but those were the dates when the times bats are active also correlated with my own activities. I tend to take walks after work, and I also sometimes take walks after dinner. The August and September bat sightings came from my after-dinner walks, during the times when it was just about dusk by the time we were walking through a park near our house—in fact, all the bats I saw were in this park. Later in September, it became too dark to see bats—and, in any case, we weren't taking as many post-dinner strolls in the dark. But then, as time passed and the days shortened, I started seeing bats again much earlier in the day, as I was coming back through the park on my way home after my post-work walk. It's been a few days since I've sen any, with a week of rain and snow, and daylight savings ends tomorrow, so it might next May when I see bats again. Or, since I'm not quite sure when I'll be walking after the time changes, the bats and I might align one more time. 

What's also interesting to me are the animals that are not particularly well represented but are evenly distributed across the months I tracked. For instance, I saw one deer each in April, June, August, and September. I saw one hairy woodpecker each in July, August, September, and October. I saw three each osprey in May, June, and August. By contrast, I saw turtles on five occasions, none later than July, which tracks with my own informal sense that you see turtles mainly in the spring and beginning of the summer. That informal sense proved less reliable when it comes to frogs, which I associate with the spring but which I saw only in July and August (two days each month). 

With numbers these low, there's no way to draw any firmer conclusions, but I wonder what I will discover if I keep tracking the animals in my area from one summer to another.
