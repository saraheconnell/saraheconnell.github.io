title: On data, capta, and
---

Thinking of Johanna Drucker's concepts of [data and capta](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html), I am reminded that this project says as much or more about my own activities as it does about animal life in my area. A very obvious indication of this is the fact that I saw green crabs and hermit crabs on just two occasions: September 12 and 26, which is to say, two days I happen to have gone to the ocean. These data points tell us nothing about the activities of marine life; they simply reflect my own movements.

Very obvious: crabs.

More subtle: bats.
