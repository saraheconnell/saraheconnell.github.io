title: Natural journaling at the end of the world
---

There's a lot of talk about silver linings these days. I find the idea more or less persuasive from day to day, but I will admit that I have been able to spend more time outside during this unusual and difficult year. Long walks down a rail trail near my house have been something between a silver lining and a quarantine coping mechanism—and, at some point in the spring of 2020, I realized that I was seeing a lot more interesting animals, as I was out at different times in the day. A few particularly exiting visits from a barred owl inspired me to start keeping track of the animals I was seeing in what I ended up calling my “Nature Journal.”

I spend a lot of my time thinking about data, but I've never tried to apply that framework to a hobby before, so this was an interesting endeavor. I ended up deciding to make the data input as lightweight as possible (not even digital!) and just write down the name of each type of animal I wanted to track and any dates that I saw them. This worked reasonably well until I'd filled up an entire row with sightings of rabbits. Undaunted, I simply started a new row with "More rabbits" and followed that practice for all the commonly-spotted animals. I also had to decide which animals were notable enough to warrant inclusion; these decisions were idiosyncratic and based not on just rarity, but also on how interesting I find the animals. Some animals that I see so often in most years that I probably wouldn't have included them ended up making the list for this summer because circumstances have changed so much. For example, I did a lot less highway driving this year, so I rarely saw hawks, woodchucks, or turkey vultures, which meant that the ones I did see became noteworthy. In one case, I did put in an entry for the most common animal in my area—squirrels—because I saw a very unusual behavior, with one squirrel carrying a smaller squirrel around its neck. I did also track juvenile animals separate from adult ones, in large part because I wanted to include ducklings, but there was no way that adult ducks would meet my threshold of notability. 

I also had to decide what counted as a sighting: I only counted certain sightings (not, "I saw a vague blur that I'm pretty sure was a rabbit") or cases where I only heard the animal, which happened a few times with barred owls. One exception I made was for what I was almost positive was a juvenile beaver, but which might have been a muskrat. I was so determined to include this exciting charming little creature that I decided to follow one of my favorite maxims—“It's better to be vague than wrong”—and I entered it as a "baby swimming rodent."

The image below shows the journal as of June 28; the current version is much more crowded and water-stained (another artifact of the times, as the first thing I tend to do when I get home from a walk is wash my hands).
