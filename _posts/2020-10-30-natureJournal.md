title: Natural journaling at the end of the world
---

There's a lot of talk about silver linings these days. I find the idea more or less persuasive from day to day, but I will admit that I have been able to spend more time outside during this unusual and difficult year. Long walks down a rail trail near my house have been something between a silver lining and a quarantine coping mechanism—and, at some point in the spring of 2020, I realized that I was seeing a lot more interesting animals because I was out at different times in the day. A few particularly exiting visits from a barred owl inspired me to start keeping track of the animals I was seeing in what I ended up calling a “nature journal.”

I spend a lot of my time thinking about data, but I've never tried to apply that framework to a hobby before, so this was an interesting endeavor. I ended up deciding to make the data input as lightweight as possible (not even digital!) and just write down the name of each type of animal I wanted to track and any dates that I saw them. This worked reasonably well until I'd filled up an entire row in the notebook I used with sightings of rabbits. Undaunted, I simply started a new row with "More rabbits" and followed that practice for all the more common animals. I also had to decide which animals were notable enough to warrant inclusion; these decisions were idiosyncratic and based not on just rarity, but also on how interesting I find the animals (by the numbers, rabbits had no business being on my list, but I like them a lot). 

The specificity of the entries reflects my current knowledge about the fauna in my area, as well as the way I tend to think about animals. I know a hawk from a handsaw (and even from a heron), but I didn't try to distinguish between different species of hawks (that said, the ones I saw are very likely to be red-tailed hawks, since those are the most common here). I did distinguish between species of woodpecker because the idea of conflating the enormous pileated woodpeckers with the much smaller hairy woodpeckers just seemed silly—if you haven't seen these before, pileated woodpeckers get up to 19 inches long and hairy woodpeckers up to 10, according to the Cornell Lab's [All About Birds](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/) site. But overall, I stuck with the group-level names for the animals I saw, rather than narrowing down to precise species. In many cases, this will tacitly map onto a species: all the "herons" (apart from one green heron which I marked separately) I saw were great blue herons, all the "deer" were white-tailed deer, all the "crabs" were green crabs, and so on.   

I also had to decide what counted as a sighting: I only counted instances when I was certain what I'd seen (not, "I saw a vague blur that I think was a rabbit" or "was that far-away bird a hawk?") and I didn't count cases where I only heard the animal, which happened a few times with barred owls. One exception I made was for what I am almost positive was a juvenile beaver, but which might have been a juvenile muskrat. I was so determined to include this charming creature that I decided to follow one of my favorite maxims—“It's better to be vague than wrong”—and I entered it as a "baby swimming rodent."

This list is very much a product of 2020. Some animals that I see so often in most years that I probably wouldn't have included them ended up making the list for this summer because circumstances have changed so much. For example, I did a lot less highway driving this year, so I rarely saw hawks, woodchucks, or turkey vultures, which meant that the ones I did see became noteworthy. In one case, I put in an entry for the most common animal in my area—squirrels—because I wanted to record a behavior I'd never seen before: one squirrel carrying a smaller squirrel around its neck. I did also track juvenile animals separate from adult ones, in large part because I wanted to include ducklings and there was no way that adult ducks would meet my threshold of notability. 

The image below shows the journal as of June 28; the current version is much more crowded and water-stained (another artifact of the times, as the first thing I tend to do when I get home from a walk is wash my hands).
