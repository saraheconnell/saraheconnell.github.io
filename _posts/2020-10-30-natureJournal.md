title: Natural journaling at the end of the world
---

There's a lot of talk about silver linings these days. I find the idea more or less pursuasive from day to day, but I will admit that I have been able to spend more time outside during this unusual and difficult year. Long walks down a rail trail near my house have been something between a silver lining and a quarantine coping mechanism—and, at some point in the spring of 2020, I realized that I was seeing a lot more interesting animals, as I was out at different times in the day. A few particularly exiting visits from a barred owl inspired me to start keeping track of the animals I was seeing in what I ended up calling my “Nature Journal.”
