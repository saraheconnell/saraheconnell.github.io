title: Full-nest syndrome—data analysis by month
---

Looking at monthly patterns for animal sightings, the effect of the seasons is immediately transparent, with a sharp increase from April to May, a slight decrease in June, a steeper increase through July and August, a very slight decrease in September, and more dramatic drop in October (I am writing this on the 31st, so I could see a few more animals today, but I don't think that the overall patterns will change). It is worth noting that my data for April is partial, since I started the journal near the end of the month and I filled in a few retroactive entries from pictures I'd taken. I don't want to make too much out of that dip in June, since it could just be chance, but it might reflect a break between the very active breeding period in May and the height of the summer. 
<br/>**April:** 9
<br/>**May:** 70
<br/>**June:** 54
<br/>**July:** 70
<br/>**August:** 81
<br/>**September:** 78
<br/>**October:** 31

It's also interesting to look at particular animals. For example, I had a late-season burst of cygnet sightings. In September, I frequently spotted a pair of swans with a single cygnet in a pond near the rail trail—the cygnet was fairly large but still much more brown than white. Overall, I saw cygnets about half as often as I saw swans and, as you'd expect, I typically saw swans whenever I saw cygnets. The one exception to this was October 2, which is also the last date I've seen any cygnets at all (I've seen swans a few times since), when I saw what I think was that same cygnet on its own in the pond. I can't be sure if the swan parents and single cygnet I saw in September are the same family I was seeing with a group of three or four cygnets in the spring, and I'm resisting the temptation to become overly reflective about this possibility, or about that lone cygnet sighting at the very end of the summer. I didn't see enough other juvenile birds to have clear patterns, but all the ducklings I saw were in May & June and all the goslings I saw were in May, which lines up with my own sense of when these tend to appear. 

The chart below shows monthly sightings for all the animals I spotted at least five times. This reveals how many animals followed the same overall trends, and also makes the prominence of rabbits particularly evident. Some animals did have slightly different patterns: although they're associated with the fall, I have seen turkeys fairly consistently from May on, and in fact the sightings dipped a bit as we got later in the season; snakes lean even more toward the beginning of the summer. Another interesting outlier is bats, which I'll discuss in the next post.
