title: Full-nest syndromeâ€”data analysis by month
---

Looking at monthy patterns for animal sightings, the effect of the seasons is quite transparent, with a sharp increase from April to May, a slight decrease in June, another steeper increase through July and August, a very slight decrease in September and more dramatic decline in October (I am writing this on the 31st, so I suppose I could see a few more animals today, but I don't think that the overall patterns will change).

|  9  |  70 |  54 |  70 |  81 |  78 |  31 |

then a steady decline from September into October. I don't want to make to much out of that dip in June, since it could just be that I myself was less active 

Here something on the match between cygnets and swans, as well as other baby animals
