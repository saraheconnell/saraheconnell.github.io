title: Full-nest syndromeâ€”data analysis by month
---

Looking at monthly patterns for animal sightings, the effect of the seasons is immediately transparent, with a sharp increase from April to May, a slight decrease in June, a steeper increase through July and August, a very slight decrease in September, and more dramatic drop in October (I am writing this on the 31st, so I could see a few more animals today, but I don't think that the overall patterns will change). It is worth noting that my data for April is partial, since I started the journal partway into the month and I filled in a few retroactive entries from pictures I'd taken. I don't want to make too much out of that dip in June, since it could just be chance, but it might reflect a break between the very active breeding period in May and the height of the summer. 

**April:** 9
**May:** 70
**June:** 54
**July:** 70
**August:** 81
**September:** 78
**October:** 31

It's also interesting to look at particular animals. For example, I had a late-season burst of cygnet sightings. In September, I frequently spotted a pair of swans with a single cygnet in a pond near the rail trail, fairly large at this point but still much more brown than white. Overall, I saw cygnets about half as often as I saw swans and, as you'd expect, I typically saw swans whenever I saw cygnets. The one exception to this was October 2, which is also the last date I've seen cygnets at all (I've seen swans a few times since), when I saw what I think was that same cygnet on its own in the pond. I can't be sure if the swan parents and single cygnet I saw in September is the same family I was seeing with a group of three or four cygnets in the spring, and I'm resisting the temptation to become overly reflective about this possibility, or about that lone cygnet sighting at the end of the summer. I didn't see as many other juvenile birds to have clear patterns, but all the ducklings I did see were in May & June and all the goslings I saw were in May. 

The chart below shows monthly sightings for all the animals I spotted at least five times. This shows how many animals followed the same overall trends, and also makes the prominence of rabbits particularly evident. Although we're going into fall now, I saw turkeys fairly consistently from May on; snakes, on the other hand, lean more toward the beginning of the summer. One interesting outlier is bats, which I'll discuss in the next post.
